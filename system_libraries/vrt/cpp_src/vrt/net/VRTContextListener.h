  /** An extension to the normal {@link VRTEventListener} that supports additional handling for

   *  and/or {@link #receivedInitialContext} are mutually exclusive with {@link #receivedPacket}. <br>
   *  <br>
   *  Note that it is an error to call {@link #receivedInitialContext} more than once (without a

   *  (per documentation and per ANSI/VITA-49.0). Accordingly the interface was forced to change

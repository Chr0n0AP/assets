# REDHAWK Vita49 Loopback Demo
 
## Description

Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK Vita49 loopback demo
waveform. This waveform uses the `rh.sourceVITA49` and `rh.sinkVITA49` components to
demonstrate how VITA49 network data can move into and out of REDHAWK.

## Installation

This is a waveform project; therefore, it does not need to be built.  It must be installed into
the `$SDRROOT/dom/waveforms` directory. To install it, open the project
in the REDHAWK IDE and drag it into the Target SDR folder..

# REDHAWK Vita49 Loopback Demo
 
## Description

Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK Vita49 loopback demo
waveform. This waveform uses the `rh.sourceVITA49` and `rh.sinkVITA49` components to
demonstrate how VITA49 network data can move into and out of REDHAWK.

## Installation

This is a waveform project and thus does not need to be built just installed into
the `$SDRROOT/dom/waveforms` directory. One way to do that is to open the project
in the REDHAWK IDE and drag it into the Target SDR Folder.

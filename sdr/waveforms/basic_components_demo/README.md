# REDHAWK basic_components_demo
 
## Description

Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK `basic_components_demo`
waveform. This waveform is an example using a few core assets. Data from an
`rh.SigGen` is created and manipulated to demonstrate the use of REDHAWK.

## Installation

This is a waveform project; therefore, it does not need to be built.  It must be installed into
the `$SDRROOT/dom/waveforms` directory. To install it, open the project
in the REDHAWK IDE and drag it into the Target SDR folder.

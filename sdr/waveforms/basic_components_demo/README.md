# REDHAWK Basic Components Demo
 
## Description

Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK Basic Components Demo
Waveform. This waveform is an example using a few core assets. Data from an
`rh.SigGen` is created and manipulated just to demonstrate REDHAWK.

## Installation

This is a waveform project and thus does not need to be built just installed into
the `$SDRROOT/dom/waveforms` directory. One way to do that is to open the project
in the REDHAWK IDE and drag it into the Target SDR Folder.

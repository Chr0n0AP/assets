# REDHAWK FM Mono Demo
 
## Description

Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK FM Mono Demo Waveform. This
waveform processes the mono audio channel of broadcast FM Radio.

## Installation

This is a waveform project and thus does not need to be built just installed into
the `$SDRROOT/dom/waveforms` directory. One way to do that is to open the project
in the REDHAWK IDE and drag it into the Target SDR Folder.

# REDHAWK FM_RBDS_demo
 
## Description

Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK `FM_RBDS_demo` waveform. This
waveform processes the RBDS digitial message present in broadcast FM radio
signals. This waveform tunes and filters the signal, performs a BPSK
demodulation, then decodes the RBDS data.

## Installation

This is a waveform project; therefore, it does not need to be built.  It must be installed into
the `$SDRROOT/dom/waveforms` directory. To install it, open the project
in the REDHAWK IDE and drag it into the Target SDR folder.

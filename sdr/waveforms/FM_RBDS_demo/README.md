# REDHAWK FM RBDS Demo
 
## Description

Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK FM RBDS Demo Waveform. This
waveform processes the RBDS digitial message present in broadcast FM radio
signals. This waveform tunes and filters the signal, performs a BPSK
demodulation, then decodes the RBDS data.

## Installation

This is a waveform project; thus, it does not need to be built.  It must be installed into
the `$SDRROOT/dom/waveforms` directory. To install it, open the project
in the REDHAWK IDE and drag it into the Target SDR folder.

 * Needed VRT library updates I have noticed:                                                                                   *
 *        supported packet types to include commands and extension commands (especially vrt::PacketType_hasStreamIdentifier)    *
 *          - DONE
 *        updated context fields                                                                                                *
 *          - DONE - restructure code to support concept of multiple CIFs
 *          - DONE - CIF0
 *          - TODO - CIF1, 2, 3, 7
 *        ensure packet length updating is automatic as the command packet is created and altered                               *
 *          - TODO - "packet length" value in header?
 *          - DONE - handled same as context packet, shifting to make space and updating packet size
 *        access to spectral data bit                                                                                           *
 *          - DONE
 *        update the data item formats to include non-normalized which is used in spectral data                                 *
 *          - DONE
 *        sample frame trailer bits might be needed                                                                             *
 *          - DONE
 *        getDataPayloadFormat's NULL value wasnt returning correctly, need to check this and possibly update the field as well *
 *          - DONE
 *        note on unsigned vs signed ints in this class:                                                                        *
 *          - agree it seems odd that signed ints are used in many cases that lend themselves better to unsigned ints
 *          - decided to remain consistent rather than a) massively change all existing code or b) do it differently here
 *          - Note that it does not appear to limit the number of usable bits to one less than would be otherwise available
 *          - Only issue noticed is assigning all 1's to a signed value produces compiler warning of implicit overflow
 *              i.e. int16_t val = 0xFFFF;
 *              This is remedied by either assigning -1 instead (which is the same value bit for bit, or explicit type casting
 *        note on 1 class for command and control:                                                                              *
 *          - original concern:                                                                                                 *
 *            "dont need create command and control choose just 1 \                                                             *
 *            Using 2 class templates causes compile issues and they are really the same unless i missed something"             *
 *          - response:
 *            I don't understand the template/compile issue mentioned, these compile fine in the library. 
 *            They are different and both needed b/c Command adds Packet Specific Prologue, which is needed for both
 *            Control and Ack packet types, but each of those have unique requirements.
 *                                                                                                                              *

Remaining:
1) finish CIF7 impl
2) finish impl of HasFields api for all new classes (and things like toString, etc.)
3) clean up naming, especially in IndicatorFields, to remove "context" and "cif" when not actually context
4) BasicControlCancelPacket class? BasicExecutionAcknowledgePacket and BasicValidationAcknowledgePacket classes? 
5) full testing of all new classes and updated API of old classes
6) TODO's and FIXME's not addressed above
